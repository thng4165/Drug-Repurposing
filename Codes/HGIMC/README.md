# HGIMC

The original code was downloaded from https://github.com/BioinformaticsCSU/HGIMC and includes the following functions:
# Functions Description


* ```fBMC.m```: this function can implement the bounded matrix completion algorithm;
* ```fGRB.m```: this function can implement the Gaussian radial basis function;
* ```fHGI.m```: this function can implement the heterogeneous graph inference algorithm;
* ```fNorm.m```: this function can normalize the similarity matrix;
* ```svt.m```: this function can implement singular value thresholding operator.

These functions are using for HGIMC algorithm

We add more two functions


The original code was downloaded from https://github.com/BioinformaticsCSU/BNNR/tree/master and includes the following three functions:

"Demo.m": Demonstrates the experimental results on the Fdataset using the BNNR algorithm.

"BNNR.m": The core implementation of the BNNR algorithm.

"svt.m": Implements the Singular Value Thresholding (SVT) operator.

We have added two additional functions:

"sort_matrix.m": Sorts or ranks the values in each column of a matrix.

"TestBNNR_CV10folds.m": Evaluates the BNNR model using 10-fold cross-validation.

How to Run
Run "Demo.m" to test the BNNR algorithm on the sample dataset.

Run "TestBNNR_CV10folds.m" to reproduce the 10-fold cross-validation results reported in our paper.
