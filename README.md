# Benchmarking heterogeneous network-based methods for drug repurposing

In this study, we systematically evaluate nine advanced heterogeneous network-based DR
methods across eight diverse datasets, including six publicly available datasets and two newly introduced
drug-disease datasets. The methods are based on (i) matrix factorization: NMF, NMF-PDR, NMF-DR
and VDA-GKSBMF, (ii) matrix completion: BNNR, OMC and HGIMC and (iii) recommendation system:
IBCF and LIBMF. We assess their performance using multiple evaluation metrics including the area under
the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR), analyze the
impact of data sparsity, and compare our findings with previous benchmarking studies.



This repository contains codes and datasets used in our study on benchmarking heterogeneous network-based methods for drug repurposing. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation scripts, and result visualization.
